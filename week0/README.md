# ‚òÅÔ∏è Introduction to Cloud Computing & DevOps Services

## ‚òÅÔ∏è What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of computing services ‚Äî such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics ‚Äî over the internet (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù).  
Instead of owning physical servers, you rent computing resources from cloud providers.

### Key Characteristics
- **On-demand self-service:** Get resources anytime without human interaction.
- **Broad network access:** Accessible from anywhere via the internet.
- **Resource pooling:** Multiple users share resources securely.
- **Rapid elasticity:** Scale up/down easily based on demand.
- **Measured service:** Pay only for what you use (pay-as-you-go).

## Cloud Service Models

| Model | Description | Example Services |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Provides virtual machines, storage, and networking. You manage OS and apps. | AWS EC2, Azure VM, Google Compute Engine |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) | Provides runtime environment for app development. You focus on code, not infrastructure. | Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service) | Fully managed software delivered via the internet. | Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Gmail |

## Cloud Deployment Models

| Model | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Public Cloud** | Owned and managed by third-party providers. | Azure, AWS, GCP |
| **Private Cloud** | Used exclusively by one organization. | VMware, OpenStack |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combination of public + private environments. | Azure Arc, AWS Outposts |
